    <h1>Super Simple Random Quote Generator API</h1>
    <div>
        <p class="lead">This is a simple quote generator API. There is currently 50 quotes in the database. I puth this together both for fun and as a way to give to the community. Please let me know if there is there is enough interest to keep working/expanding on this project.</p>
        <p> I am currently experimenting with Heroku's free tier for this project. This means three things.</p>
        <p>1. Heroku's free tier will put an app to sleep that hasn't been used in 30 minutes. So if your having trouble getting data please go to https://random-quote-generator.herokuapp.com/ in your browser and wait a minute for the app to wake up. </p>
        <p>2. Because this is the free tier and I don't have any money I may be forced to pull this down or ask for donations if it gets enough usage and I begin to get charged. </p>
        <p>3. We get what we pay for in life so I make no guarantees to the speed/user experience of this app. </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Usage: There are currently two enpoints to this API and both take GET requests</h2>
